// Shared constants for the desktop shell.
//
// The window loads the BACKEND'S OWN ORIGIN, never file://. That is the
// load-bearing decision of this whole app:
//   * frontend/src/lib/nav.js uses History API paths with no hash, so
//     pushState("/stock/NVDA") throws a SecurityError under file://.
//   * vite.config.js sets no `base`, so assets emit as absolute /assets/...
//     which under file:// resolve to the filesystem root.
//   * auth is a single httpOnly SameSite=Lax cookie on the backend origin
//     (backend/app/auth.py) — there is no token in JS to relay.
// Same-origin makes all three non-issues, with zero frontend changes.
//
// 127.0.0.1 rather than "localhost" on purpose: uvicorn binds IPv4 only and
// Windows resolves localhost to ::1 first, so a localhost origin can fail to
// connect outright. They are also separate cookie jars — mixing the two
// loses the session mid-OAuth. windows/install-service.ps1 sets the service's
// STOCKS_CORS_ORIGINS and STOCKS_OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE to match this exactly.
