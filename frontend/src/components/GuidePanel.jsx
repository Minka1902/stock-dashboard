            Each module gathers one kind of <strong>public</strong> signal. The Boom Score simply adds
            the bullish ones up and subtracts the bearish ones, so a high score means several
            independent sources agree right now. Nothing here is a forecast — it's a fast way to spot
            "something is happening here," with the receipts attached. If a source can't be reached it
            shows an error rather than inventing data.
