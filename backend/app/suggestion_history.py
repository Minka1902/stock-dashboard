"""Suggestion history: what we said about a stock, and what it did next.

Scope is deliberately narrow (watchlisted and held tickers only) and the stored
record is deliberately lean — ticker, day, kind, action, reference price. The
"what happened next" side is *derived* from the stored daily bars every time it
is read, so it is always current and can never drift from the price data.

History accrues from the day this ships. There is no backfill: reconstructing
suggestions we never made would be inventing them.
