# Design

Visual system for the Stock Signal terminal. Dark-first, monospace-led, one committed accent. The metaphor is a pro trading desk: a strict ruled grid carries a maximal, vivid surface so intensity never reads as chaos.

## Theme

Dark, non-negotiable. Scene: a self-directed ADHD investor scanning market mood and their own positions on a large monitor in a dim home office before the open, wanting to feel in command. Light theme is a supported fallback but the design is tuned for dark.

## Color

Strategy: **Committed**. A warm amber phosphor accent carries brand, selection, focus, and "live" state across the surface. Data direction is a separate, fixed semantic pair (up = mint, down = crimson) so the accent never competes with price meaning. Amber is deliberately chosen to dodge the four reflexes: not SaaS purple, not corporate gold-on-navy, not crypto neon-green, not console cyan.

All values OKLCH. Neutrals are tinted a hair warm (hue ~80, chroma ≤ 0.011) so the whole surface reads as one family. Never `#000` / `#fff`.

Dark (primary):
- `--bg`: oklch(0.145 0.007 80)
- `--surface`: oklch(0.183 0.008 80)
- `--surface-2`: oklch(0.223 0.009 80)
- `--surface-3`: oklch(0.265 0.010 80)  (raised: menus, active row)
- `--grid`: oklch(1 0 0 / 0.055)  (hairline ruling, the terminal skeleton)
- `--border`: oklch(1 0 0 / 0.11)
- `--border-strong`: oklch(1 0 0 / 0.22)
- `--text`: oklch(0.945 0.006 80)
- `--text-muted`: oklch(0.72 0.010 80)
- `--text-faint`: oklch(0.56 0.012 80)
- `--accent`: oklch(0.82 0.145 75)   (amber phosphor)
- `--accent-strong`: oklch(0.76 0.16 68)
- `--accent-weak`: oklch(0.82 0.145 75 / 0.15)
- `--accent-glow`: oklch(0.82 0.145 75 / 0.35)  (used only for focus/live glow)
- `--positive`: oklch(0.84 0.17 158)  (mint, price up)
- `--positive-weak`: oklch(0.84 0.17 158 / 0.16)
- `--negative`: oklch(0.64 0.215 20)  (crimson, price down)
- `--negative-weak`: oklch(0.64 0.215 20 / 0.16)
- `--info`: oklch(0.74 0.11 232)  (cool, neutral/secondary series)

Light (fallback): same roles, lightness inverted, chroma trimmed ~15%, accent darkened to oklch(0.62 0.15 68) for AA on light.

Semantics: up/down is never color-only. Always pair with a glyph (▲ ▼), sign, or position so it survives color-blindness and the dyslexia mode.

## Typography

Monospace-led, the terminal signature.
- `--mono`: ui-monospace, "SF Mono", "Cascadia Code", "Segoe UI Mono", "Roboto Mono", Consolas, monospace. Carries all numbers, tickers, labels, table data, most UI chrome. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` everywhere numbers align.
- `--sans`: system-ui, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif. Prose only: news bodies, help text, longer copy. Capped 68ch.
- Labels are uppercase mono, letter-spacing 0.08em, `--text-faint`, small (11px). This "terminal caption" is the primary hierarchy device.
- Scale (fixed rem, ratio ~1.2): 11 / 12.5 / 14 / 17 / 22 / 30 / 44. Big numbers (gauge score, position P/L) use the top of the scale in mono, weight 600.
- Hierarchy from weight + case + color, not many sizes.

## Layout

- App shell: slim fixed left rail (icon + mono label) with exactly the five modules, a market-lean status strip pinned top, a live ticker tape below it. Rail footer holds only a Settings gear (utility, not a module).
- Every view is a **ruled grid**: 1px `--grid` hairlines divide regions (no floating cards). Regions are labeled with the uppercase-mono caption in their top-left, like terminal panes.
- Density is a feature: tables run edge to edge, rows are compact (32-36px), zebra via `--surface`/`--surface-2` at very low delta.
- Avoid the SaaS card grid entirely. Use ruled panes, split columns, and full-bleed tables. No nested containers.
- Responsive is structural: rail collapses to icon-only, multi-column panes stack.

## Elevation

Mostly flat. Depth via hairline borders and a faint 1px top highlight, not drop shadows. Raised surfaces (command palette, menus) get `--surface-3` + a single soft shadow. No glassmorphism. The only glow in the system is the amber focus/live glow, used sparingly.

## Components

Consistent vocabulary, every state (default / hover / focus / active / disabled / loading / error):
- **Stat cell**: mono label (caption) + big tabular number + signed delta with ▲/▼ in positive/negative. The atomic unit; never a gradient hero tile.
- **Meter bar**: inline block-bar (`████░░░░`) or thin track, used for conviction, gauges, allocation. Amber or semantic fill.
- **Fear→Greed gauge**: the hero of Market Sentiment. A wide horizontal spectrum with an animated amber needle and a big mono score.
- **Ticker tape**: horizontally scrolling live quotes, mono, colored deltas, pausable, respects reduce-motion.
- **Data table**: sticky mono header (uppercase caption), tabular-nums, row hover = `--surface-3`, right-aligned numerics, inline sparklines.
- **Source badge**: every data region shows a live/stale/error dot + "updated Ns ago" (honest state, never hidden).
- **Command palette (⌘K)**: keyboard jump to any of the five views and quick actions. Terminal-native, ADHD quick-nav.
- Loading = skeleton rows/shimmer, never center spinners. Empty states teach ("add holdings to see P/L"), never blank.

## Motion

Maximal but meaningful, and fully collapsible under `prefers-reduced-motion` / the reduce-motion setting.
- Timing 120-220ms, ease-out-expo / quart. No bounce.
- Numbers count-up / roll on change; fresh data shimmers once; the gauge needle eases to position; "live" dots pulse; the ticker tape scrolls.
- Never animate layout properties; transform/opacity only.
- Reduce-motion collapses all of the above to instant state changes; nothing essential is motion-only.

## Signature

If you removed the amber and the monospace ruling, it should stop looking like this product. The tell: ruled terminal panes with uppercase-mono captions, tabular numbers with ▲/▼ deltas, an amber live-glow, and a hero Fear→Greed gauge.
