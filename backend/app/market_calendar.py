"""Trading-day calendars and clock-based session status — NYSE and TASE.

No external dependency at runtime: both calendars are small explicit tables.

NYSE: weekends plus a hardcoded set of observed holidays / half days, with
pre-market (04:00) and after-hours (to 20:00) sessions around 09:30–16:00 ET.

TASE (Tel Aviv, Asia/Jerusalem): **Monday–Friday since 2026-01-05** (before
that the week was Sunday–Thursday). Sessions, per TASE's announcement as
reported by Globes: Mon–Thu 10:00–17:35, Fri 10:00–13:50 (derivatives to
14:00). Verified against Yahoo intraday bars for TA35.TA / TEVA.TA through
2026-09: the last 5-minute bar starts 17:25 Mon–Thu and 13:45 on Fridays.
TASE has no pre-market or after-hours trading, so its status is only ever
LIVE or CLOSED.

TASE holidays follow the Hebrew calendar. The closure and early-close dates
below are copied from exchange_calendars 4.13.2's XTAE calendar (a maintained
source, which already models the Mon–Fri week; its 17:15 Mon–Thu close is the
pre-2026 hour, so only its *dates* are used). The 2026 list was cross-checked
against the days Yahoo has no TA35.TA/TEVA.TA bars — all 14 closures through
2026-09-25 match. ASSUMPTION: 2027–2028 dates are XTAE's rule-derived
projections; TASE publishes the official list each year — re-check them
against the TASE vacation schedule when it does, and extend the tables.
