/**
 * An anchored popup that is immune to its parent's stacking and clipping.
 *
 * Every menu in the app used to be `position: absolute` inside its trigger's
 * wrapper. That looks right and fails in two ways once the page has tables:
 *
 *  - The top band sets `backdrop-filter`, which creates a stacking context.
 *    A z-index inside it is only compared against its siblings, so a menu
 *    could never outrank a sticky table row — the row won on DOM order and
 *    sliced the menu in half.
 *  - Panels are `overflow: hidden` and table wrappers `overflow-x: auto`, so
 *    a row-level menu was clipped by its own container.
 *
 * Rendering to <body> escapes both. The trade-off is that position must be
 * computed rather than inherited, so it is recalculated on scroll (capturing,
 * to catch inner scrollers) and resize.
 *
 * Anchoring uses `right` rather than a translateX so it does not fight the
 * transform Motion animates.
